    <h2>About the Plant</h2>
    <p>
        A Sewage Water Treatment Plant (STP) is a facility designed to treat wastewater
        from homes, industries, and institutions. The goal is to remove pollutants
        and make the water safe to release back into the environment or reuse.
    </p>
</section>

<section id="process">
    <h2>Detailed Sewage Treatment Process</h2>

    <h3>1. Preliminary Treatment</h3>
    <p>
        This is the first stage of treatment where large and floating materials are removed.
        Screening removes plastics, rags, and debris, while the grit chamber removes sand,
        stones, and gravel. Oil and grease are also separated at this stage.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Primary Treatment</h3>
    <p>
        In primary treatment, wastewater is allowed to settle in a sedimentation tank
        called a primary clarifier. Heavy solids settle at the bottom as primary sludge,
        and lighter materials float on the surface and are skimmed off.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Secondary Treatment (Biological Treatment)</h3>
    <p>
        Secondary treatment removes dissolved and organic matter using microorganisms.
        This is the most important stage of sewage treatment.
    </p>

    <h4>a) Activated Sludge Process (ASP)</h4>
    <p>
        Air is supplied to wastewater in an aeration tank to support bacterial growth.
        These bacteria consume organic matter. The mixture then flows to a settling tank
        where sludge is separated and recycled.
    </p>

    <h4>b) Moving Bed Biofilm Reactor (MBBR)</h4>
    <p>
        In MBBR, plastic carrier media provide a surface for bacterial growth.
        The media moves freely in the aeration tank, ensuring efficient treatment
        with less space and maintenance.
    </p>

    <h4>c) Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR)</h4>
    <p>
        SBR treats sewage in batches. All processes such as filling, aeration,
        settling, and decanting occur in a single tank, making it compact and efficient.
    </p>

    <h4>d) Trickling Filter</h4>
    <p>
        Wastewater is sprinkled over a bed of stones or plastic media where a biofilm
        develops. Organic matter is broken down as water trickles through the filter.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Tertiary Treatment (Advanced Treatment)</h3>
    <p>
        This stage improves the quality of treated water for reuse. It includes sand
        filtration, activated carbon filtration, and disinfection using UV light,
        chlorine, or ozone.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Sludge Treatment</h3>
    <p>
        Sludge collected from primary and secondary treatment is thickened, digested,
        dewatered, and dried. Treated sludge can be safely disposed of or used as manure.
    </p>

    <h3>6. Treated Water Reuse / Disposal</h3>
    <p>
        The final treated water is reused for gardening, flushing, and industrial
        purposes or safely discharged into natural water bodies as per pollution norms.

<section id="importance">
    <h2>Why It Is Important</h2>
    <p>
        Sewage treatment prevents water pollution, protects aquatic life, reduces
        health risks, conserves water, and supports sustainable development.
